# One way of doing it

Do as I have: modify a hot plate and add a SSR within it to turn it on and off on demand.

# Another smarter way

Have your SSR enabling/disabling a regular plug or power cord and plug your hotplate with full-on settings in said plug.

# Observations

Put the thermocouple sensor on the outside of your plate, under aluminium foil. Inside a hot plate enclosure things remain hot
for long.

This code is ugly but at least it does not abuse delay().
